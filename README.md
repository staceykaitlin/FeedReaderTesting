# Udacity Feed Reader Testing

This project is a part of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. In this project I was given a we-based application that reads RSS feeds. I was required to write the remaining test suites from an incomplete Jasmine test suite and get them to pass.


## How to run the app

1. Download or clone this repository

2. Find index.html and open the file in your browser

3. You will see the Jasmine tests at the bottom on the index.html page

4. You can edit the suites via jasmine/spec/feedreader.js

Review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io) if needed
